#  Anti-Website Website

**Anti-Website Website** is an intentional UX anti-pattern experiment.

It breaks every “best practice” on purpose — not as a joke, but as a way to understand **why good UX works by making bad UX impossible to ignore**.

> Good UX is invisible. This one isn’t.

---

##  Concept

Most websites try to help users succeed.

This one actively **resists** them.

Anti-Website Website explores frustration as a design material and interaction as conflict rather than cooperation.

The project treats the user as a participant in a system that pushes back.

---

##  Features (Intentionally Bad)

- **Navigation that refuses clicks**
- **Scroll that fights user input**
- **Buttons that run away**
- **Fake loading screens that lie**
- **Tooltips that judge your actions**
- **Mobile-only chaos mode**
- **Rage-quit detection**
- **Local frustration leaderboard**

Every interaction is designed to feel *wrong* — and to make that wrongness obvious.

##  Why This Exists

This project was built to explore:

- Why usability matters
- How quickly frustration emerges
- How interaction design shapes emotional response
- The invisible rules we rely on in “good” UX

By violating these rules, the project reveals their importance.

---

##  Tech Stack

- **HTML / CSS / Vanilla JavaScript**
- No frameworks
- No backend
- No analytics
- No mercy

All behavior is handled client-side, intentionally avoiding complexity to keep the focus on interaction design.

---

##  Mobile-Only Chaos Mode

On mobile devices, the experience becomes intentionally unstable:

- Orientation flips
- Random scroll jumps
- Loss of spatial predictability

This reinforces how fragile mobile UX can be when conventions are ignored.

---

##  Rage-Quit Detection

The project tracks frustration signals such as:

- Aggressive scrolling
- Repeated failed interactions
- Rapid clicking
- Abrupt session exits

A local “leaderboard” stores peak frustration scores per device.

No data leaves the browser.
